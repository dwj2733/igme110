                        The last few weeks before a game's release, known as crunch time, can 
                        include mandated work on the weekends and well over 8 hours a day required to be spent at the workplace completing 
                        the finishing touches on the game.

                    Video Game studios deal with this especially hard because deadlines are such a big part of Game Development, as 
                    there is a lot of pressure from game producers and larger tech companies to get games out by set release dates. 
                    This problem is compounded by the increase of complexity of more recent games, as the more code there is in a 
                    project, the bigger the chance that something can go wrong last minute and need hours upon hours of overtime 
                    (usually unpaid), to correct.  Companies in the gaming industry generally do not pay overtime hours for this work 
                    because of their desire to profit. This high stress work typically drives workers away from jobs in which it 
                    is present, and the more times it happens with a given employer, the more likely an employee is to search for another 
                    job. CD Projekt Red has had struggles with crunch in the past, especially when releasing larger titles like The Witcher 3, but seeks to solve those 
                    problems in the future. The co-founder of CD Projekt Red, Marcin Iwi≈Ñski, released 
                    <a href="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2017/articles/2017-10-16-15-53/witcher_statement.jpg/EG11/resize/586x-1/quality/75/format/jpg">
                    a statement</a> apologizing to his former employees for the hard work hours, and making a promise to reduce the amount of crunch work needed for later projects.
