                        The Witcher 3, CD Projekt Red’s previous game received a 
                        massive expansion, called Wild Hunt. This provided around 50 additional hours of gameplay, all 
                        completely free for every player.

                    Besides investing loads of money into Keanu Reeves and other actors to ensure top level 
                    acting and story in Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt Red plans on supporting the game with free 
                    expansions of the story. CD Projekt Red has historically supported its games with extended 
                    story expansions, providing more content for players based on positive feedback about the 
                    original release of the game and allowing developers more time to work on side quests or post-game 
                    content after the initial release date. CD Projekt Red has no direct monetary gain from releasing free expansions 
                    and content to players who have already purchased their games, but their consistent will to provide 
                    players with accessible content has gained them a lot of trust from the gaming community. The concept 
                    of paid add-ons and loot boxes is a topic of a lot of contention in gaming recently, but paid expansions 
                    are generally considered to be the most acceptable form of additional paid content, as it provides more 
                    of the story that players purchased the game to experience, with a reasonable price given the work put 
                    into creating it by the game developers. CD Projekt Red’s direct opposition to including loot boxes in 
                    their game also shows that they aren’t simply releasing games as a cash grab and rushing the release, 
                    as many game companies are under fire for doing.
