                        Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most anticipated games of the next year, but the design and story are
                        not the only impact it will have on the future of gaming.

                        CD Projekt Red is breaking new ground in the game development 
                        industry with Cyberpunk 2077 by focusing on reducing crunch, promoting inclusivity, and having a focus on the 
                        quality of the game.

                    <br><br>
                    The game development industry has many issues 
                    that have been consistent over the last few decades. CD Projekt Red, the company behind the Witcher series 
                    and the upcoming game Cyberpunk 2077, has the potential to change the way game companies design their games 
                    and treat their employees. While CD Projekt Red still suffers from some of the same downfalls that most 
                    companies do, such as a need for excessive amounts of crunch time, pressure to meet deadlines, and pressure 
                    from producers to make a profit off the game, they have made major steps to be better than other companies 
                    in the industry and are widely respected for that.
